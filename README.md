# Handwritten_Recognition_MNIST
This model uses convolutional neural network in PyTorch and train it to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

## Dataset
MNIST contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits: 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing. The images are grayscale, 28x28 pixels.

## Method
convolutional neural network 

## Model Evaluation 
Test Accuracy of the model on the 10000 test images: 0.99%
